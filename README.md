# MustyBooking
 
This is my take on a Booking.com clone web application, using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS! Although not a complete application, it displays my application of tokens, authentication for users, and security by hashing user passwords. I utilized MongoDB (NoSQL) as the database to store user information as well as administrator information. If a user wants to book a room, they can reserve it accordingly. Administrators will be able to access the admin screen, where they can track customer reservations.
